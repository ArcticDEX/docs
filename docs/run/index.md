# Run nodes

---

Ceramic node operators are responsible for hosting the various [Ceramic networks](../learn/networks.md). Ceramic clients need to connect to nodes in order to access the network.

The guides below describe how to run a daemonized Ceramic node that can be used as a remote node by the [JS HTTP Client](https://developers.ceramic.network/build/javascript/installation/#js-http-client) or the [Ceramic CLI](https://developers.ceramic.network/build/cli/installation/#4-configure-a-node-url).

## **Launching a node**

---

> When running a node it is best to start by connecting to the [Clay testnet](https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/networks/#clay-testnet). When you are ready to move to mainnet, reach out to the 3Box Labs team on Discord: [https://discord.gg/tsQXsG8Sde](https://discord.gg/tsQXsG8Sde).

### [**Run Ceramic in development →**](../build/cli/installation.md)

Set up a local Ceramic node for development and testing purposes.

### [**Run Ceramic in production →**](./nodes/nodes.md)

Run a reliable, performant Ceramic node in the cloud or on bare metal for use by production applications.
